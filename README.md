# Digital phase-lead and deadbeat compensators.

The first part is the design of a phase-lead digital controller with small steady state error, small settling time, minimum input action, and minimum overshoot. The second part is a deadbeat controller that reaches zero error very fast at sampling instants in discrete domain systems.
